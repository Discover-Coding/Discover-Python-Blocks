How to create blockly lessons.

There are multiple template files avialable as a starting template:
all.html
empty.html

Copy any one of them to a new lesson/activity file.
i.e.

SUGGESTED FILE NAME FORMAT

1.html (blocks for lesson 1)
1-2.html (blocks for lesson 1, activity 2)
2-1.html (blocks for lesson 2, activity 1)

etc...

The Blockly HTML files are simply <category> and <group> tags.
They can be re-ordered in any way desired.
The categories can be re-named if desired.
